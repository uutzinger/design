## A - Engineering Design Principles

Cross-cutting principles like problem definition, clinical need, plausibility and feasibility, trade-offs, constraints, user center design, payer, regulatory compliance (e.g., FDA, ISO), risk analysis, prototyping, and testing.

---

### A-1 Problem Definition and Requirement Analysis
 - Unmet clinical need
 - Plausibility (is there evidence that the problem can be addressed)
 - Feasibility (do we have ability to create a solution)
 - User Analysis (intermediate impact on user/patient)
 - Societal Outcomes (impact beyond user/patient)
 - Constraints
 - Functional versus Nonfunctional Requirements
 - Writing Design Specifications

---

### A-2 Conceptual Design and Ideation
 - Brainstorming, Ideation
 - Functional Decomposition
 - Sketching Diagramming
 - Tradeoff Matrices, Decision Making

---

### A-3 Design Documentation and Communication
 - Technical Writing
 - Design Review Presentation
 - Notebook, lab journals, version control
 - System Diagram, Specifications

---

### A-4 Risk Management and Reliability
 - Hazard Analysis
 - Risk prioritization and mitigation
 - Redundancy, Safety Margin, Robustness
 - Tolerance and Uncertainty

---

### A-5 Prototyping and Integration
 - Prototyping (rapid)
 - Iteration
 - Specification Validation
 - Product Verification
 - Test plan for validation and verification
 - Human Subjects Testing

---

### A-6 Design for Manufacturability
 - Materials and Process Selection
 - Assembly Process
 - Minimizing Cost and Complexity

---

### A-7 Regulatory and Standard Awareness
 - Medical Device Classes
 - Design Controls
 - Design Standards
 - Traceability and Documentation for Regulatory Submission

---

### A-8 Ethics, Sustainability and Human Factors
 - Accessibility and Inclusiveness
 - Environmental Impact
 - Human Subjects Ethics
 - Design for diverse populations

---

### A-9 Systems Thinking and Integration
 - System Interfaces
 - Modularity, Upgradability, Maintenance
 - Compatibility between Components
 - System Level Behavior
