üéì **Student Project: Design and Testing of a Hydrogel-Based Wound Dressing**

**Project Overview:**  
Students design, fabricate, and test a **hydrogel-based wound dressing** aimed at promoting healing while preventing infection.  
The project covers **material selection**, **biocompatibility considerations**, **mechanical testing**, and **functional evaluation**.

---

### **Learning Objectives**
- Select a **biocompatible hydrogel formulation** suitable for skin contact.
- Incorporate **antimicrobial properties** (e.g., silver nanoparticles, chitosan).
- Optimize **mechanical strength and water retention** properties.
- Evaluate **biodegradation rate** and moisture release.
- Understand **sterilization methods** and their effect on material properties.

---

### **Core Design Tasks**

#### üß™ *Material Selection and Preparation*
- Choose hydrogel base material (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, alginate, collagen).
- Add crosslinkers to control gel stiffness and swelling.
- Incorporate antimicrobial agents or growth factors.

#### üè≠ *Fabrication*
- Cast hydrogel sheets in molds of desired thickness.
- Crosslink via chemical, UV, or freeze-thaw methods.
- Sterilize samples (gamma, ethylene oxide, or autoclave if compatible).

#### üìè *Characterization Testing*
- **Mechanical testing**: tensile strength, elongation at break.
- **Swelling ratio** and **water vapor transmission rate (WVTR)**.
- **Antimicrobial activity**: zone of inhibition test against *E. coli* or *S. aureus*.
- **Degradation test** in simulated wound fluid.

#### üßç *Biocompatibility Assessment*
- Perform in vitro cytotoxicity test (e.g., MTT assay with fibroblast cells).
- Observe cell attachment and proliferation on hydrogel surface.
