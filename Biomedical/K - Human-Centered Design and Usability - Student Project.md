üéì **Student Project: Redesign of a Pulse Oximeter Interface for Elderly Users**

**Project Overview:**  
Students analyze an existing pulse oximeter and redesign the **user interface and physical form** to improve usability for elderly patients with limited dexterity, vision, or hearing.

---

#### **Learning Objectives**
- Conduct **usability testing** with representative users.
- Apply **human factors principles** to medical device design.
- Create a **prototype interface** with improved accessibility features.
- Document improvements with **quantitative and qualitative feedback**.

---

#### **Core Design Tasks**
##### üîç User Research
- Interview or survey elderly participants about challenges with current devices.
- Observe device usage in simulated real-world conditions.
- Identify high-friction interaction points.

##### üõ† Redesign
- Modify display for larger, high-contrast text.
- Add haptic or auditory feedback for button presses.
- Adjust physical housing for easier grip and reduced insertion force.

##### üìè Evaluation
- Conduct before-and-after usability tests.
- Measure task completion time, error rate, and satisfaction scores.
- Gather user preference feedback through interviews.
