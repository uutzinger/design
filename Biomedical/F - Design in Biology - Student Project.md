ðŸŽ“ **Student Project: Engineering Bacteria to Detect Glucose in Saliva**

**Project Overview:**  
Students design a **synthetic biology system** where a genetically engineered bacterial strain produces a visible signal (e.g., color change, fluorescence) in response to glucose levels in saliva.  
The focus is on **biological sensing mechanisms, genetic circuit design, and assay validation**.

---

#### **Learning Objectives**
- Apply **synthetic biology principles** to create a biological sensor.
- Understand **promoter-repressor systems** and gene expression control.
- Design and test **reporter gene constructs** (e.g., GFP, chromogenic proteins).
- Validate system sensitivity and specificity for glucose detection.
- Address biosafety, ethics, and containment.

---

#### **Core Design Tasks**
##### ðŸ§¬ Genetic Circuit Design
- Select a glucose-responsive promoter (natural or engineered).
- Link promoter to a **reporter gene** for visual output.
- Optimize plasmid backbone for expression in *E. coli* or other safe chassis organisms.

##### ðŸ§ª Laboratory Prototyping
- Transform host bacteria with the engineered construct.
- Prepare control and test groups with varying glucose concentrations.
- Record and quantify visual signals (absorbance or fluorescence).

##### ðŸ“Š Data Analysis
- Generate a calibration curve linking signal intensity to glucose concentration.
- Assess systemâ€™s limit of detection and dynamic range.
- Evaluate response time from glucose exposure to signal output.

##### ðŸ§¼ Biosafety & Containment
- Design for use in **BSL-1 laboratory conditions**.
- Implement kill-switch or auxotrophy to prevent survival outside the lab.

#### **Safety and Feasibility Notes**
- Project must be conducted in a **BSL-1 lab** using non-pathogenic organisms.
- No human saliva samples should be used without proper ethics approval â€” use artificial saliva for initial testing.
- Ensure compliance with institutional biosafety guidelines.
