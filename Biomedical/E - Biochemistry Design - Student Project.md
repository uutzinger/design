üéì **Student Project: Portable Uric Acid Detection Device Using Enzymatic Biosensor**

**Project Overview:**  
Students design and prototype a **portable uric acid measurement system** for point-of-care testing.  
The device uses an **enzymatic biosensor** to detect uric acid levels in biological fluids (e.g., blood, saliva) and displays results digitally.  
The emphasis is on **biochemical sensor integration**, calibration, and user-friendly design.
