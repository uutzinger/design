🎓 **Student Project: Wearable Fall Detection Device for Elderly Patients**

**Project Overview:**  
Students work in teams to design and document a **complete engineering design process** for a wearable device that detects falls and sends alerts to caregivers.  
The focus is on applying **core design principles** — from requirements gathering to prototyping — rather than on advanced technical specialization.

---

#### **Learning Objectives**
- Apply the **full engineering design cycle** (problem definition → design → testing → iteration).
- Develop **functional and non-functional requirements**.
- Practice creating **design documentation** including schematics, mechanical drawings, and test plans.
- Perform **verification and validation** activities.
- Incorporate **human factors** into device usability.

---

#### **Core Design Tasks**
##### 📝 Requirements & Planning
- Identify **stakeholders** (patients, caregivers, clinicians) and gather user needs.
- Translate needs into **design inputs** with measurable specifications.
- Create a **Gantt chart or project plan**.

##### 🛠 Prototyping & Integration
- Build a rapid prototype (could use Arduino + accelerometer).
- Integrate mechanical housing, electronics, and software into one unit.

##### 🧪 Testing & Verification
- Create a **test plan** covering:
  - Accuracy of fall detection.
  - Battery life under typical use.
  - Comfort and wearability.
- Perform **verification** (does design meet requirements?) and **validation** (does it meet user needs?).

##### 🔄 Iteration
- Analyze test results.
- Modify design to address failures or usability issues.

---

#### **Optional Enhancements**
- Add GPS for location reporting during emergencies.
- Integrate Bluetooth to connect with a smartphone app.
- Implement machine learning to distinguish between falls and normal movements.

---

#### **Deliverables**
- Complete **Design History File** (DHF) including requirements, schematics, CAD files, and test results.
- Working prototype.
- Verification & validation report.
- Presentation to class simulating a design review.

---

#### **Safety and Feasibility Notes**
- Use only safe, low-voltage electronics.
- Simulate falls in controlled conditions — no real harmful testing on humans.
