üéì **Student Project: Wearable Multi-Parameter Physiological Monitor for Rehabilitation Patients**

**Project Overview:**  
Students design a **wearable device** capable of monitoring multiple physiological parameters during patient rehabilitation (e.g., heart rate, respiration rate, joint movement).  
The project emphasizes **sensor placement, signal acquisition, and interpretation** in the context of physiological system models, along with **clinical usability**.

#### **Learning Objectives**
- Understand **sensor selection and placement** for accurate physiological measurement.
- Integrate hardware and software for **real-time data acquisition**.
- Relate measured data to **physiological system models** (e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal).
- Consider **ergonomics and patient comfort**.
- Apply **data interpretation** for rehabilitation progress tracking.

#### **Core Design Tasks**
##### üß† Physiological Needs Analysis
- Identify key physiological metrics relevant to rehabilitation.
- Select sensing methods (e.g., ECG, accelerometer, goniometer, respiration belt).
- Map metrics to patient outcomes and rehabilitation goals.

##### üìê System Design
- Create **block diagrams** showing sensor integration, data acquisition modules, and power supply.
- Determine optimal sensor placement for reliable signals while maintaining comfort.

##### üõ† Prototyping
- Implement signal acquisition circuits (amplification, filtering).
- Connect sensors to a microcontroller or wearable data logger.
- Program data acquisition and logging software.

##### üìä Data Analysis
- Develop algorithms to calculate physiological parameters (e.g., joint range of motion, breathing rate).
- Compare recorded values to known physiological ranges.

##### üë• User Testing (Simulated)
- Conduct tests with healthy volunteers or mannequins simulating rehabilitation exercises.
- Gather feedback on comfort and usability.
