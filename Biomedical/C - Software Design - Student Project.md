üéì **Student Project: Mobile App for Remote Patient Monitoring**

**Project Overview:**  
Students design and implement a **software system** for remote monitoring of patient vitals (e.g., heart rate, oxygen saturation) using data from a wearable biomedical device.  
The focus is on **software architecture, modular coding practices, and integration with hardware**.

---

#### **Learning Objectives**
- Develop **modular, maintainable software** using good programming practices.
- Interface with **external hardware** over BLE, USB, or Wi-Fi.
- Implement **data acquisition, storage, and visualization**.
- Apply **error handling** and **data validation** methods.
- Incorporate **basic security measures** for patient data.

---

#### **Core Design Tasks**
##### üèó Architecture & Planning
- Define **system requirements** and user stories.
- Create a **modular architecture diagram** (e.g., data acquisition ‚Üí processing ‚Üí UI).
- Select appropriate programming language(s) (e.g., Python, Java/Kotlin, C++).

##### üîå Hardware Interface
- Implement communication with the device (BLE GATT services, serial port, or REST API).
- Parse incoming physiological data into usable formats.

##### üìä Data Processing & Storage
- Filter and smooth raw data for better readability.
- Store historical data locally or in a secure cloud database.
- Implement basic analytics (e.g., alert if heart rate exceeds threshold).

##### üé® User Interface
- Design a **mobile or desktop application UI** for displaying vitals in real time.
- Include graphical plots and historical trends.

##### üõ° Security & Privacy
- Implement **basic encryption** for transmitted data.
- Apply user authentication and access controls.

- Implement integration with **FHIR** (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for EHR compatibility.
- Include AI-based anomaly detection for early warning.

---

#### **Deliverables**
- Software source code with documentation.
- Architecture diagram and design documentation.
- Working prototype demonstrating data acquisition and display.
- Verification & validation report against requirements.

---

#### **Safety and Feasibility Notes**
- Use **simulated or pre-recorded datasets** for initial testing to avoid reliance on patient data.
- Ensure all stored data is anonymized for privacy compliance.
