## I Design in Health Sciences
The design of systems and processes that integrate technology with **clinical practice**, support **healthcare workflows**, protect **patient data privacy**, and contribute to **public health** through data collection, analysis, and decision support.

---

### I-1. Workflow Integration
- **Clinical Environment Mapping** – Understanding hospital, clinic, and home-care workflows.
- **Device Interoperability** – Using standards such as HL7, FHIR, and DICOM for data exchange.
- **Minimizing Workflow Disruption** – Designing devices/software to fit seamlessly into existing practices.
- **Automation Opportunities** – Reducing clinician workload with smart systems.
- **Clinical Decision Support (CDS)** – Integrating algorithms that assist diagnosis or treatment planning.

---

### I-2. User Interaction with Clinical Systems
- **User-Centered Design (UCD)** – Engaging clinicians, patients, and caregivers in design iterations.
- **Usability Testing** – Ensuring intuitive operation with minimal training.
- **Accessibility** – Designing for diverse abilities, languages, and literacy levels.
- **Error Prevention & Feedback** – Clear alerts, step-by-step guidance, fail-safe mechanisms.

---

### I-3. Epidemiological Modeling
- **Data Sources** – Electronic Health Records (EHRs), public health databases, wearable sensors.
- **Model Types** – SIR/SEIR models, agent-based simulations, time-series forecasting.
- **Applications** – Disease outbreak prediction, resource allocation, intervention impact assessment.
- **Integration with Health Policy** – Presenting model outputs for decision-makers in usable formats.

---

### I-4. Health Data Privacy & Security
- **Regulatory Compliance** – HIPAA (US), GDPR (EU), and local privacy laws.
- **Data Anonymization & De-identification** – Removing or masking personal identifiers.
- **Secure Data Transmission** – Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest.
- **Access Control** – Role-based permissions, audit logging.
- **Cybersecurity in Healthcare** – Threat modeling, intrusion detection, incident response.

---

### I-5. Safety & Risk Management
- **Clinical Safety** – Avoiding harm from device misuse or malfunction.
- **Infection Control** – Designing for sterilization, disinfection, or disposability.
- **Human Factors Risk Analysis** – Identifying how design might lead to user error and mitigating it.
