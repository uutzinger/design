üéì **Student Project: Adjustable Prosthetic Hand Prototype**

**Project Overview:**  
Students design and prototype a **mechanical system** for a low-cost, adjustable prosthetic hand suitable for partial upper-limb amputees.  
The focus is on **mechanical design principles**, material selection, ergonomics, and manufacturability.

---

#### **Learning Objectives**
- Apply **mechanical design principles** to a biomedical device.
- Create **3D CAD models** and technical drawings.
- Select materials balancing **strength, weight, and biocompatibility**.
- Integrate **mechanical linkages** with potential future electromechanical actuators.
- Consider **manufacturing methods** for low-cost production.

---

#### **Core Design Tasks**
##### üìê Concept Development
- Define functional requirements (e.g., grip strength, range of motion, weight limit).
- Brainstorm and sketch multiple design concepts.
- Choose a final design based on functional analysis.

##### üñ• CAD & Modeling
- Create detailed **3D CAD models** of the prosthetic.
- Perform **stress and motion analysis** using simulation tools.
- Generate **dimensioned technical drawings** for manufacturing.

##### ‚öô Mechanism Design
- Design **linkages** for finger movement (cable, tendon-driven, or geared mechanisms).
- Ensure adjustability for different hand sizes.

##### üßµ Material & Manufacturing
- Select materials (e.g., aluminum, ABS, carbon fiber) considering cost and safety.
- Choose a manufacturing method (3D printing, CNC machining, injection molding).

##### üõ† Prototyping & Assembly
- Fabricate components using available lab resources.
- Assemble and adjust the prototype.
- Test fit and comfort on a non-clinical model (dummy arm).
