## G Design in Physiology
The design of systems that monitor, interface with, support, or replace physiological functions, including organ systems, neural pathways, and musculoskeletal structures. It combines physiological modeling with engineering design for diagnostics, therapy, and restoration of function.

### G-1 Physiological System Modeling
- Block diagram representation of organ systems (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, respiratory)
- Compartment models for fluid, drug, and solute transport (e.g., for dialysis or glucose dynamics)
- Simulation of physiological control loops (e.g., baroreflex, respiratory rate, thermoregulation)
- Use of modeling tools: MATLAB/Simulink, Python, OpenSim, COMSOL

### G-2 Sensor Placement and Physiological Signal Acquisition
- Surface and implantable electrode placement (e.g., ECG, EMG, EEG, ECoG)
- Understanding physiological signal characteristics: amplitude, frequency, noise
- Artifact suppression and signal conditioning (e.g., motion artifacts, EM interference)
- Tissue-electrode interface design and impedance matching
- Sensor placement constraints due to anatomy, motion, and user comfort
