üéì **Student Project: Clinical Workflow Optimization Tool for Vital Signs Monitoring**

**Project Overview:**  
Students design a **digital tool or device interface** that automates and streamlines the **recording and transfer of patient vital signs** from bedside devices to the hospital‚Äôs EHR system.

---

#### **Learning Objectives**
- Map an existing clinical workflow and identify inefficiencies.
- Design an interface compatible with medical data standards (HL7/FHIR).
- Ensure secure and compliant data transfer (HIPAA-compliant encryption).
- Create an intuitive user interface for nurses or technicians.
- Evaluate time savings and error reduction.

---

#### **Core Design Tasks**
##### üîç Workflow Analysis
- Shadow clinicians during vital signs collection.
- Document current data entry process and pain points.
- Identify points for automation or integration.

##### üíª Interface & System Design
- Develop a prototype application or middleware to connect vital sign monitors to EHR.
- Implement secure API communication using HL7 or FHIR.
- Design a simple, clear UI with minimal steps per task.

##### üìè Evaluation
- Simulate patient rounds and compare manual vs automated processes.
- Measure time per patient, error rates, and clinician feedback.

#### **Skills Practiced**
| Domain                | Skills Practiced |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| Systems Integration   | HL7/FHIR implementation, device-EHR interfacing |
| Cybersecurity         | Encryption, authentication, access control |
| UX/UI Design          | User flow mapping, usability testing |
| Clinical Engineering  | Workflow observation, clinician collaboration |
| Data Handling         | Structured health data storage and retrieval |

---

#### **Optional Enhancements**
- Add voice-to-text for note-taking during rounds.
- Implement anomaly detection (flagging out-of-range vitals automatically).
- Integrate with wearable devices for continuous monitoring.

---

#### **Deliverables**
- Workflow analysis report with diagrams.
- Functional prototype (software or hardware interface).
- Security and compliance documentation.
- Usability test results and improvement recommendations.

---

#### **Safety and Feasibility Notes**
- Use only simulated patient data for testing.
- Ensure all network communications occur in a controlled lab environment.
