## H Materials and Biomaterials Design
The selection, characterization, and design of materials intended for **contact with biological systems** — either temporarily (catheters, wound dressings) or permanently (implants, prosthetics). Includes ensuring **biocompatibility, mechanical performance, and manufacturability** while meeting regulatory and clinical needs.

### H-1. Material Selection Criteria
- **Biocompatibility**  
  - Non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, non-immunogenic  
  - Resistance to corrosion or degradation in body fluids  
  - Minimal leaching of harmful compounds
- **Mechanical Properties**  
  - Strength, elasticity, fatigue resistance, toughness  
  - Matching mechanical properties to tissue (e.g., compliance matching in vascular grafts)
- **Chemical Stability**  
  - Resistance to hydrolysis, oxidation, enzymatic degradation
- **Sterilization Compatibility**  
  - Material integrity under autoclave, gamma irradiation, ethylene oxide, or plasma sterilization
- **Regulatory Approval**  
  - Material must meet standards (e.g., ISO 10993 biocompatibility testing)

### H-2. Classes of Biomaterials
- **Metals** – Titanium, stainless steel, cobalt-chrome alloys (implants, fixation devices)  
- **Polymers** – Polyethylene (PE), PTFE, PEEK, silicone (catheters, joint liners, tubing)  
- **Ceramics & Glasses** – Alumina, zirconia, bioactive glass (dental implants, bone fillers)  
- **Composites** – Fiber-reinforced polymers, ceramic-polymer blends (bone plates, prosthetics)  
- **Hydrogels** – PEG, alginate, collagen-based (drug delivery, tissue scaffolds)  
- **Natural Materials** – Collagen, chitosan, silk fibroin (scaffolds, wound dressings)

### H-3. Surface Engineering & Modification
- **Coatings** – TiN, diamond-like carbon, hydroxyapatite for improved wear, osteointegration, or hemocompatibility  
- **Surface Roughening or Patterning** – Promoting cell adhesion or preventing bacterial attachment  
- **Chemical Functionalization** – Immobilizing bioactive molecules, anti-fouling PEG layers  
- **Plasma Treatment & Etching** – Modifying surface chemistry for better bonding or wettability

### H-4. Degradable vs. Non-Degradable Materials
- **Degradable** (temporary implants, sutures, drug delivery)  
  - Polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), polycaprolactone (PCL)  
  - Designed for predictable resorption time  
- **Non-Degradable** (permanent implants, prosthetics)  
  - Titanium alloys, UHMWPE, ceramics  
  - Designed for long-term stability without significant property loss

### H-5. Tissue-Material Interactions
- **Protein Adsorption** – First step in biological response; impacts cell adhesion  
- **Cell Adhesion & Proliferation** – Influenced by surface chemistry/topography  
- **Foreign Body Reaction** – Fibrous encapsulation, inflammation, immune activation  
- **Hemocompatibility** – Preventing thrombosis for blood-contacting devices

---

### H-6. Testing & Characterization
- **Mechanical Testing** – Tensile, compressive, flexural, fatigue, hardness  
- **Surface Characterization** – SEM, AFM, contact angle, XPS  
- **Biocompatibility Testing** – Cytotoxicity, sensitization, irritation, hemolysis, genotoxicity  
- **Degradation Studies** – Mass loss, molecular weight change, pH changes in degradation media

---

### H-7. Design for Manufacturing & Integration
- **Processing Techniques** – Molding, machining, additive manufacturing, extrusion, sintering  
- **Joining Methods** – Welding, adhesive bonding, press-fit assembly  
- **Dimensional Stability** – Shrinkage, warping, thermal expansion  
- **Integration with Electronics** – Encapsulation, hermetic sealing, feedthroughs

---

### H-8. Special Considerations
- **Drug-Eluting Materials** – Incorporating controlled drug release  
- **Smart Materials** – Shape-memory alloys/polymers, stimuli-responsive hydrogels  
- **Anti-Microbial Surfaces** – Silver nanoparticle coatings, quaternary ammonium compounds  
- **Bioresorbable Electronics** – Temporary sensing/therapy devices that dissolve after use
