ðŸŽ“ **Student Project: Mini Design History File (DHF) for a Hypothetical Class II Medical Device**

**Project Overview:**  
Students work in teams to create a **mock Design History File** for a simple Class II device (e.g., a wearable pulse oximeter) as if preparing for an FDA 510(k) submission.

---

#### **Learning Objectives**
- Understand the components of a DHF.
- Practice creating **design inputs/outputs** traceability.
- Apply basic **risk management** per ISO 14971.
- Document **verification and validation** activities.

---

#### **Core Design Tasks**
##### ðŸ“„ Documentation Development
- Write **design input requirements** linked to user needs.
- Create **design output documents** (drawings, component specifications).
- Develop a **traceability matrix** linking inputs â†’ outputs â†’ verification tests.

##### âš  Risk Management
- Perform a **hazard analysis** using FMEA.
- Propose risk controls and evaluate residual risk.

##### âœ… Verification & Validation Planning
- Define **verification test plans** (bench testing).
- Outline **validation methods** (simulated or actual user testing).

#### **Skills Practiced**
| Domain              | Skills Practiced |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Regulatory Affairs  | FDA/CE documentation structure |
| Quality Systems     | Design controls, document control |
| Risk Management     | FMEA, ISO 14971 application |
| Engineering Design  | Requirements writing, traceability |
| Compliance Testing  | Test plan development |

---

#### **Optional Enhancements**
- Include mock **labeling and Instructions for Use (IFU)** meeting regulatory requirements.
- Create a **pictorial process flow** of manufacturing steps.
- Add **post-market surveillance** planning.

---

#### **Deliverables**
- Mock Design History File (DHF) package.
- Traceability matrix.
- Risk management file.
- Verification/validation plan.

---

#### **Safety and Feasibility Notes**
- This is a **paper exercise**â€”no real patient testing.
- All testing references should use simulated data or bench models.
