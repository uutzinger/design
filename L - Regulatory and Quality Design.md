## L Regulatory and Quality Design

The integration of **regulatory compliance** and **quality management principles** into the medical device design process, ensuring safety, efficacy, and adherence to applicable laws, standards, and guidelines. Covers both **product development processes** and **documentation** required for market clearance/approval.

---

### L-1. Regulatory Frameworks
- **United States** – FDA regulations, especially **21 CFR Part 820** (Quality System Regulation).
- **Europe** – EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR), **CE Marking** requirements.
- **International** – ISO 13485 (Quality Management Systems), ISO 14971 (Risk Management).
- **Other Markets** – Japan PMDA, Health Canada, TGA (Australia).

---

### L-2. Design Controls (per 21 CFR 820.30)
- **Design and Development Planning** – Documented plan with deliverables and timelines.
- **Design Inputs** – Clear, measurable requirements based on user needs and intended use.
- **Design Outputs** – Drawings, specifications, and manufacturing instructions meeting inputs.
- **Design Review** – Formal checkpoints to evaluate progress and compliance.
- **Design Verification** – Confirm design outputs meet input requirements.
- **Design Validation** – Confirm device meets user needs and intended use.
- **Design Transfer** – Hand-off to manufacturing with complete, controlled documentation.
- **Design Changes** – Formal change control process with impact analysis.

---

### L-3. Quality Management System (QMS)
- **Document Control** – Managing SOPs, work instructions, records.
- **Training and Competency Records** – Ensuring personnel are trained for their roles.
- **Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)** – System to address and prevent recurring issues.
- **Internal Audits** – Regular checks of QMS compliance.
- **Supplier Management** – Qualification, monitoring, and control of external suppliers.

---

### L-4. Risk Management
- **ISO 14971 Compliance** – Risk analysis, evaluation, control, and residual risk assessment.
- **Hazard Analysis Techniques** – FMEA, FTA, hazard analysis tables.
- **Benefit-Risk Analysis** – Demonstrating that benefits outweigh residual risks.

---

### L-5. Clinical Evaluation & Post-Market Surveillance
- **Clinical Evaluation Reports (CER)** – Required for CE Marking.
- **Post-Market Surveillance (PMS)** – Monitoring device performance after release.
- **Vigilance Reporting** – Reporting adverse events to authorities (MDR, FDA).

---

### L-6. Regulatory Submissions
- **United States** – 510(k), De Novo, PMA applications.
- **Europe** – Technical File / Design Dossier for CE Marking.
- **Documentation Requirements** – Device description, labeling, risk analysis, testing data, manufacturing processes.
