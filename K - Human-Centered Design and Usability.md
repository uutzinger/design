## K Human-Centered Design and Usability
The process of designing medical and healthcare devices, software, and systems **around the needs, abilities, and limitations of end-users** — including clinicians, patients, and caregivers — to ensure safety, effectiveness, and satisfaction.

---

### K-1. Principles of Human-Centered Design (HCD)
- **User Involvement from the Start** – Engage stakeholders early through interviews, shadowing, and observation.
- **Iterative Design** – Rapid prototyping and feedback loops to refine design.
- **Context of Use Analysis** – Identify physical, environmental, and workflow conditions under which the device will operate.
- **Inclusive Design** – Accommodate users with different ages, abilities, languages, and technical literacy.

---

### K-2. Usability Engineering in Healthcare
- **ISO 62366 Compliance** – Standard for usability in medical devices.
- **Use-Related Risk Analysis (URRA)** – Identify and mitigate risks caused by design-induced user errors.
- **Task Analysis** – Break down procedures to optimize steps, reduce complexity, and prevent mistakes.
- **Formative vs Summative Usability Testing** – Early-stage feedback vs regulatory submission testing.

### K-3. Accessibility
- **Physical Accessibility** – Device size, weight, reach, and control layout.
- **Sensory Accessibility** – Clear visual displays, tactile feedback, auditory cues.
- **Cognitive Accessibility** – Simple, consistent navigation; avoiding overload; using plain language.
- **Regulatory Alignment** – ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) for digital interfaces.

---

### K-4. Ergonomics
- **Anthropometric Data Use** – Designing to fit human size ranges (e.g., 5th to 95th percentile).
- **Posture and Reach** – Minimizing strain, optimizing control placement.
- **Grip and Force Requirements** – Ensuring comfortable operation for intended user population.
- **Long-Term Use Comfort** – Especially critical for wearables or implantables.

---

### K-5. User Experience (UX) in Clinical Settings
- **Information Clarity** – Present only necessary information at the right time.
- **Feedback and Status Indicators** – Provide clear confirmation of actions, alerts for errors or hazards.
- **Error Recovery** – Offer clear steps to correct mistakes without restarting the process.
- **Visual Hierarchy** – Organize interface elements for quick scanning under stress.

---

### K-6. Clinical Integration
- **Workflow Fit** – Align with existing clinical routines and avoid unnecessary extra steps.
- **Training Requirements** – Minimize learning curve; design for quick onboarding.
- **Multi-User Environments** – Support role-based permissions and simultaneous access.
- **Environmental Constraints** – Lighting, noise, mobility limitations in clinical spaces.
